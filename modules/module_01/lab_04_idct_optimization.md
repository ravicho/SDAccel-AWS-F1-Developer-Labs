This lab builds on top of previous labs which gave an overview of the Vitis development environment and explained the various performance analysis capabilities provided by the tool using different reports. This lab, will demonstrate these analysis capabilities and use them to drive and measure performance improvements enabled by code optimizations. This lab illustrates the dataflow optimization and loop pipelining variations effects on overall performance.

>**NOTE**: Although the entire lab is performed on an F1 instance, only the steps that involve the use of FPGA card need to run on F1 instance. All the interactive development, profiling and optimization steps would normally be performed on-premise or on a cost-effective AWS EC2 instance such as C4. However, to avoid switching from C4 to F1 instance during this lab, all the steps are performed on the F1 instance.

If the terminal window at the end of the previous lab was closed, open a new one, run setup script and go back to the project folder:

1.  Source the Vitis environment  

    ```bash
    source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_setup.sh
    ```

2. Go to the project folder

    ```bash
    export LAB_WORK_DIR=/home/centos/src/project_data/
    cd $LAB_WORK_DIR/Vitis-AWS-F1-Developer-Labs/modules/module_01/idct
    ```

## Optimizing the IDCT Kernel using Dataflow

In this section different simple experiments are carried out that will illustrate the effects and power of dataflow optimization. The FPGA binary used for experiments is built to have four different kernels. There are minor differences among them and they are created to illustrate different performance optimizations. This experiment will focus on two kernels namely **krnl_idct** and **krnl_idct_noflow** and compare them.

### Comparing FPGA Resource Usage

1. Open kernel source files and compare

    ```bash
    vim src/krnl_idct.cpp
    vim src/krnl_idct_noflow.cpp
    ```

   These files contain description for both of these kernels. They are exactly identical kernel with different names and one major difference: Dataflow optimization is enabled for **krnl_idct** in **krnl_idct.cpp** whereas it is not used for other kernel **krnl_idct_noflow** in **knrl_idct_noflow.cpp**. It can be sees by going to a label called "DATAFLOW_PRAGMA" which is placed as marker near line 358 in both the files. An HLS Pragma is applied here, it is enabled for "krnl_idct" and disabled for other by commenting out. The application of this pragma makes functions in the region execute concurrently and create a function pipeline which overlaps compute in different functions as compared to full sequential execution. The functions in this region are connected through FIFOs also called hls::streams, it is one of the recommended style for the functions used in dataflow region, given that the data is produced or consumed in same order at every function boundary.

1. To look at the synthesis report for latency and II to compare expected performance, proceed as follows:

    ```bash
    cd $LAB_WORK_DIR/Vitis-AWS-F1-Developer-Labs/modules/module_01/idct
    vim src/host.cpp
    ```

    Go to label **CREATE_KERNEL** near line 226 and make sure the kernel name string is "krnl_idct" and run hardware emulation as follows:

    ```bash
    make run TARGET=hw_emu
    ```

   The hardware emulation will build all variations of kernels and use **krnl_idct** for emulation. Now open Vitis HLS reports(or use link summary) as follows and see different metrics:

    ```bash
    cd $LAB_WORK_DIR/Vitis-AWS-F1-Developer-Labs/modules/module_01/
    vim ./build_hw_emu/reports/krnl_idct.hw_emu/hls_reports/krnl_idct_csynth.rpt
    ```

   From performance estimate section under Latency, note down :
   - Latency
   - Interval
   - Pipeline

   Under Utilization section note different resources utilized:
   - Block RAMs
   - FFs
   - DSPs
   - LUTs

   For the second kernel note the same metrics by opening the following report:

   ```bash
   vim ./build_hw_emu/reports/krnl_idct_noflow.hw_emu/hls_reports/krnl_idct_noflow_csynth.rpt
   ```

   By comparison one should notice that the performance of the kernel with dataflow optimization is almost 3 times better in terms of Latency and II and the resource utilization is pretty much still the same.

### Comparing Execution Times and Application Timeline

#### Kernel with Dataflow Optimization

The next thing which can be seen is the compute unit execution time by using the profile summary reports. The hardware emulation for kernel "kernel_idct" was already ran, which uses dataflow optimization, now open the profile summary report using vitis_analyzer as follows:

```bash
vitis_analyzer ./build_hw_emu/xclbin.run_summary
```

   * Once the vitis_analyzer is open, select **Profile Summary** from the left pane, then select **Kernel and Compute Units** section. It gives execution estimates for kernel and compute unit. Compute Unit Utilization section reports min/max/avg estimated execution times note it down.
   * Next, open the application time line by selecting "Application Timeline" from left hand panel and it opens up in right side main window.
   * Zoom in close to first transaction happening on device time line on read/write interfaces, snapshot for this is shown in the figure below and focus on the part marked by yellow box:

![](images/module_01/lab_04_idct/hwEmuComputMemTxOverLap.PNG)

It can be observed from this timeline that:

- There is overlapping activity at the read and write interfaces for compute unit essentially meaning things are happening concurrently(read_block/execute/write_block functions running concurrently).

- The amount of overlap seems marginal because a very small data size has been intentionally chosen for emulation. Overlapping will increase during the actual hardware or system run where a larger data size is used.

#### Kernel without Dataflow Optimization

1. Open `host.cpp` and make changes so that hardware emulation will use the second kernel namely "krnl_idct_noflow" and then run the emulation again:

    ```bash
    vim src/host.cpp
    ```  

    Go to label "CREATE_KERNEL" near line 226 and change the kernel name string to "krnl_idct_noflow" and run hardware emulation:

    ```bash
    make run TARGET=hw_emu
    ```

   Open the profile summary again and note the compute unit execution time and compare it with kernel with dataflow optimization. It will be 2-3x worse. Ideally, it should be 3x since the II was three times more but due to memory bandwidth effects, it can come down.

2.  Open the application time line trace and check the compute unit activity:

     ```bash
    vitis_analyzer ./build_hw_emu/xclbin.run_summary
    ```  

    It will show something similar to the figure below. Look at the section highlighted by the yellow box and compare it to kernel execution with dataflow optimization, one can easily find that all activity happened sequentially, it shows no overlap at all, essentially the time line can be interpreted as:

    * sequential read: kernel first executes read_block function marked by data read activity on **coeffs** and **inBlocks** interfaces

    * process: kernel processes input data blank period before write

    * write activity: lastly write_block execution marked by data write activity on **outBlocks** interface

## Kernel Loop Pipelining Using Various Initiation Intervals (IIs)  

This section is about experimenting with the Initiation Interval for loop pipelining. To make this experiment easier, different kernels that are almost identical except with different names and IIs have been included. To understand the kernel code structure open:

```bash
vim src/krnl_idct.cpp
```

Go to label "FUNCTION_PIPELINE" near line 37. one can see four different function calls within the dataflow optimization region:

- read_blocks
- read_blocks
- execute
- write_blocks

The read and write blocks simply reads data and writes data from memory interfaces and streams it to execute function which calls IDCT function to perform the core compute. The read and write functions can be pipelined with desired II with overall performance dictated by "execute" function II. It is a functional pipeline where all of these functions will be constructed as chain of independent hardware modules. The overall performance will be defined by any block that has the lowest performance which essentially means largest II. Since execute block carries out almost all compute so II variation on this block will show significant overall performance and resource utilization variations.

Now lets do actual system runs using a pre-built FPGA binary file. Xclbin or AFI for AWS F1 can built using the provided makefile but to save time a pre-built binary is provided.

To see how pipeline pragmas with different II are applied to kernels, open different kernel source files and compare II constraints placed near label "PIPELINE_PRAGMA:" in each file around line 297, it have IIs as follows:

- krnl_idct      : II=2
- krnl_idct_med  : II=4
- krnl_idct_slow : II=8

```bash
    vim src/krnl_idct.cpp
    vim src/krnl_idct_med.cpp
    vim src/krnl_idct_slow.cpp     
```

>**NOTE**: II = 1 cannot be achieved because the device DDR memory width is 512 bits(64 Bytes) and IDCT compute if done in single cycle requires (64*size(short)*8=1024) 1024 bits (128 bytes) per cycle. In terms of how this fact manifest in our model can be seen by going to "execute" function to find that it will require 2 reads or writes on FIFO I/O interfaces in single cycle which is not possible.

### Initiation Interval versus FPGA Resource Usage

To get the look and feel of II effects on resources, results from hardware emulation runs are used since it also performs kernel synthesis. Since hw_emulation was ran in a previous experiment, just go ahead into build folder and look at the Vitis HLS reports to find out Initiation Interval and Latency for these kernels as well as resource utilization. The resource utilization will have a trend showing decrease in utilization with increase in II.

To do so, open and compare synthesis report to note down IIs/Latencies and resource utilization ( one can also use link summary as discussed in previous lab):

    ```bash
    vim ./build_hw_emu/reports/krnl_idct_med.hw_emu/hls_reports/krnl_idct_med_csynth.rpt
    vim ./build_hw_emu/reports/krnl_idct.hw_emu/hls_reports/krnl_idct_csynth.rpt
    vim ./build_hw_emu/reports/krnl_idct_slow.hw_emu/hls_reports/krnl_idct_slow_csynth.rpt
    ```

### Initiation Interval versus Acceleration

It is estimated in previous labs that kernel with II=4 may be able to run at maximum throughput but to show the effects of II on overall performance start with II=8 and then run with II=4 and finally with II=2. The results reported here and on the machine you are using may vary depending on the memory subsystem performance specially PCIe bandwidth available at run time to the application.

#### Performance with II=8

1. Open and modify host code to run "krnl_idct_med" as follows:

    ```bash
    cd $LAB_WORK_DIR/Vitis-AWS-F1-Developer-Labs/modules/module_01/
    vim src/host.cpp
    ```

   Go to label "CREATE_KERNEL" near line 226. Ensure that the kernel name string is "krnl_idct_slow" and build host application again as follows:

    ```bash
    make compile_host TARGET=hw
    ```    

2. Run host application as follows:

	```bash
	./build/host.exe ./xclbin/krnl_idct.hw.awsxclbin $((1024*128)) 32 1
	```

	it shows an output like the one shown below, which shows FGPA acceleration by a factor of 7x:

    ```

    ```

   Go to label "CREATE_KERNEL" near line 226 and make sure the kernel name string is "krnl_idct_med" and build host application again as follows:

   ```bash
   make compile_host TARGET=hw
   ```    
1. Run the host application as follows:

	```bash
	./build/host.exe ./xclbin/krnl_idct.hw.awsxclbin $((1024*128)) 32 1

    ------ TEST PASSED ------
    =====================================================================
    FPGA accelerations ( CPU Exec. Time / FPGA Exec. Time): 9.60113
    =====================================================================
    ```
#### Performance with II=2

1. Open and modify host code to run "krnl_idct" as follows:

    ```bash
   vim src/host.cpp
    ```

   Go to label "CREATE_KERNEL" near line 226 and make sure the kernel name string is "krnl_idct" and build host application as follows:

   ```bash
   make compile_host TARGET=hw
   ```    
2. Run the host application on the AWS F1 instance. Perform the Xilinx runtime setup and launch the application as follows:

    ```bash
    source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_runtime_setup.sh
    ./build/host.exe ./xclbin/krnl_idct.hw.awsxclbin $((1024*128)) 32 1
    ```

    it will show FGPA acceleration by a factor of about 11x:

    ```
    Execution Finished
    =====================================================================
    ------ All Task finished !
    ------ Done with CPU and FPGA based IDCTs
    ------ Runs complete validating results
    CPU Time:        1.89434 s ( 1894.34ms )

    ------ TEST PASSED ------
    =====================================================================
    FPGA accelerations ( CPU Exec. Time / FPGA Exec. Time): 11.3477
    =====================================================================
    ```   
>**NOTE**: In last three experiments, with II going from eight to four and then two, the overall performance should be going up by 2x every time but it was not the case. The reason for this is that performance is not only defined by kernel or compute performance but it also depends on the memory bandwidth available to CU and host at different times and sometime it dictates performance. However, it is clear from the last experiment that II variations have significant effect on performance and hardware resource consumption.

## Summary  

In this lab, you learned the following:

- Using dataflow optimization to improve performance
- Effect of the II variation during loop pipelining on performance and resource utilization
